# Jim-Boarding

## What is it?

Jim-Boarding is a script completely remade from, but based on rd_cars.

This script handles using skateboards and Surfboards as items to ride them around the streets or Beaches or Los Santos

The player can do tricks on the board to show off their skills

The best part is they can fail them and faceplant it <3

There is also support for animal peds to ride them, they wil thank you but the other players with complain like its the worst thing in their life

Supports the addition of multiple board items if you have custom models you wish to add
 - Just add a new item, and place the itemname and model in the config

Starting support for SurfBoards, but cant figure out how to shut them up, any help with that would be great
- I believe I need a placeholder jetski vehicle with the audio muted, but this is beyond my abilities

### Disclaimer:
```
This is based originally on "ElectricSkateboardFiveM" but completely rewritten and changed to handle newer fivem features

With the help of `jim_bridge` this also brings more optimization and more features and works on multiple frameworks
```
